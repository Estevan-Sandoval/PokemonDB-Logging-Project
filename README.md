# PokemonDB-Logging-Project
Python notebook which simulates data analysis and logging using the PokeAPI.
This project was built to practice logging and analyzing both inputs and outputs during simulated generative AI text generation.  
The goal wasn’t to produce perfect analysis or polished results — it was to get comfortable with tracking, storing, and reviewing the flow of data through a program.

## Overview
The notebook fetches Pokémon data from the PokéAPI, creates simulated “AI-generated” descriptions, and logs both the prompts (inputs) and generated text (outputs).  
It then performs basic analysis and visualization to explore the outputs — such as how long descriptions are, how prompts are distributed, and how varied the results can be.

## Key Points
- Uses Python logging to record inputs and outputs  
- Generates synthetic Pokémon descriptions for experimentation  
- Performs simple statistics and visualizations on generated outputs  
- Emphasizes workflow observability over result quality

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python** (pandas, requests, logging, random)
- **Plotly** for visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** for iterative development

## Purpose
This project was meant as a hands-on exercise in **logging**, **data tracking**, and **output analysis** — not to produce the most sophisticated model ever. I also wanted to kick off some of the rust my Python skills have developed.
